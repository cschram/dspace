# DSpace

DSpace is a little space shmup game. It's a rewrite of a game I made a few years ago, this time written in D mostly as an exercise to learn the language and game programming patterns.

```
$ unzip lib.zip
$ dub
```

Currently I only have DSFML shared files in lib.zip for 32-bit windows and 64-bit linux.
